# Repository Uruguay 2024 Elections Candidate Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the candidates who ran in Uruguay's October 2024 elections. The goal is to examine party representation, regional distributions, voter-candidate overlap, and socioeconomic factors (specifically, Necesidades BÃ¡sicas Insatisfechas).

## Structure

- `data`  
  This folder contains all the raw datasets necessary to perform the analysis. It includes information about candidates (their party affiliation, voting location, and so on), and additional datasets for socioeconomic indicators.

- `output`  
  This folder contains all the figures and visualizations generated by the notebook. These outputs help illustrate the findings related to party representation, voter-candidate overlaps, geographic distributions, and correlations with socioeconomic data.

- `candidatos_new_version.ipynb`  
  The main Jupyter Notebook that performs the analysis. It combines the data, processes it, and produces the figures stored in the `output` folder.

## Structure
