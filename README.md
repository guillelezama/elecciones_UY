# Elecciones_UY

This repository contains a collection of interactive applications and Jupyter Notebooks designed to explore and analyze Uruguay’s electoral data from 2004 through 2024. Each component serves a specific purpose, ranging from individual voter information lookups to broader demographic and geographic analyses.

## Contents

1. **`app_1`**  
   An interactive application where you can enter any *credencial* (Uruguayan voter ID) to see how that person’s precinct (*circuito*) voted in national elections between 2004 and 2019.

2. **`app_busqueda_after_election`**  
   A specialized application built for *Semanario Búsqueda* that allows users to input a *credencial* and retrieve voting details for both the 2019 and 2024 elections, including first and second rounds.

3. **`map_busqueda`**  
   Another application tailored for *Semanario Búsqueda*. This tool provides an interactive map of Uruguay and displays how each *Serie* (a code identifying a city or neighborhood) voted in the 2019 and 2024 elections, for both rounds.

4. **`candidates`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook analyzing the geographic origins (based on where they voted) of the candidates for each major political party.

5. **`series`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook examining changes in voting behavior over time by leveraging Uruguay’s stable voter identification system. Specifically, it tracks the evolution of the *Frente Amplio* (FA) vote share in each precinct from 2004 to 2024.

6. **`edades`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook comparing the support Yamandú Orsi received from different age groups in Uruguay. It highlights how *new voters* (those who did not vote in the previous election) differ from older cohorts in terms of their voting behavior.
